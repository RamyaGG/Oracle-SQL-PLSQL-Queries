step 1

create or replace type circle as object
(xc number(10,2), yc number(10,2), area number(10,2),
peri number(10,2), member procedure setpar(x in number, y in number, r in number), 
member procedure compute, member function getarea return number, 
member function getperi return number);


step 2

create or replace type body circle as
member procedure setpar (x in number, y in number, r in number) is
begin
xc:=x;
yc:=y;
rad:=r;
end;
member procedure compute is
begin
area:=3.142*rad*rad;
peri:=2.0*3.142*rad;
end;
member function getarea return number is
begin
return area;
end;
member function getperi return number is
begin
return peri;
end;
end;
